BlenRig is an Auto-rigging and skinning system for the Blender 3.1+ families. It provides the user with a Feature Film quality rig (including an advanced facial system).

The current version only supports Biped characters, but more presets will be supported in the future.

Rig creation includes:

_BlenRig armature.

_BlenRig Mesh Deform cage and Lattices.

_Already rigged Weight Transfer Meshes, for automatically weighting characters.


Usage
=====


You will find the rig in the **Object Add Panel**, under the **Armature Menu**.

In the **View3d Sidebar** (N Key) you will find all controls and tools. Rig your character by adding the BlenRig rig to the scene and then starting up the **Automated Rigging Guides** in the **Rigging Assistant** section of the BlenRig GUI.
